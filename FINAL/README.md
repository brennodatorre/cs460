This is a simple project,
That has a lot of Reminders.

Just go to the link https://brennodatorre.github.io/cs460/FINAL/
and you should see the default room and option.

Have fun!

I just click to add a post-it note onto a mesh.

The post-it can be re-sized, re-colored, and can have a random rotation.
The user can also upload any glb file that they want to use. 
The file will then be used as the object to be interacted with.
