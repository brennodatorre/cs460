      RO.ME is a very cool webgl demo, to be honest it was quite interesting to experience what it is capable of
      It did not feel like I was controlling the "game" in my browser. 
      Putting into contrast to the old flash games that we all grew up using, it is mind blowing that such things can be 
      rendered and run within the bounds of the web browser. 
      No FPS drops was crazy.

      Technology: It uses the computer's graphic card to genarate the experience in the browser.
      This is done with html and javascript.

      Comparison: This one is a less artistic and more functional implementation of webgl. This guy's a bit more simple, 
      where the user is able to click in the rendered object(a calculater) in order to get a bunch of information to help 
      their project planning.

      Significance (AI): Ro.me (“3 Dreams of Black”) was important because it proved that high-quality, 
      real-time 3D graphics could run directly in a web browser without plugins. 
      It wasn’t just a tech demo—it combined storytelling, music, and interactive 3D worlds, 
      showing that the web could be a platform for immersive, artistic experiences. This helped popularize WebGL, 
      inspired tools like Three.js, and set the stage for today’s web-based games, VR/AR, and creative interactive media.
